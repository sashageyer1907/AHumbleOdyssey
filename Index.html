         This month marks fifty-one years since my mother,
         Slavica (Anglicised to ‘Jane’) Susak, her parents and two
         younger siblings migrated from former-Yugoslavia to Australia.
         Born in Opovo, a rural town in Serbia’s Vojvodina province,
         her early upbringing was typical of Slavic village life
         “living in mud brick houses, working off the land dictated by the
         seasons  - albeit a happy country childhood”.
         With a population in the mid-4000s that has remained stagnant
         over the last century, Opovo is a modest and traditional place.
         Her parents’ decision to move was made in a matter of days,
         her father’s sister sponsored their family to join her in Melbourne
         as part of Australia’s mid-century migration boom.
         Their migration was purely economical rather than political -

         other Opovo workers proudly standing with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz
         Tito hangs in our home.

Aged seven, my mother and her family left for Australia in
late-October 1966. They took a train from Belgrade to Athens
before boarding the legendary Patris ship from Piraeus (Athens’ main port)
to Melbourne. She doesn’t recall any farewell festivities, only a strange
situation of thoughtlessly crossing a busy road outside Belgrade’s central
railway station that outlined her inexperience with city life.
“For whatever reason I just bolted”, she laughs. The voyage contained many
firsts for mum; first train ride, first time outside of Yugoslavia, first time
staying in a hotel (for the overnight stop-over in Athens) and first boat ride.

<p>
<p>
<p>
The Patris ship is known for migrating
tens of thousands of Greek and Eastern-European
migrants to Australia from the 1950s to 1970s.
It travelled down the Suez Canal, an Egyptian waterway
that connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, with the
entire route taking around a month. “Even though my sister was
sick with the measles, I really enjoyed the boat trip”, mum recalls,
“it was fun”. The ship was divided into gendered sections with a
range of facilities, including a cinema. “I remember going to see my
first Elvis Presley film, <i> Blue Hawaii</i>, and at the climax of the
film ‘The End’ was spelt out and reading it in cyrillic trying to
work out what those words meant”.

        A generational language barrier
        between my mother, her siblings and their
        late-parents has made childhood memories all the
        more hazy. This results in vague approximations of
        their migration timeline, with the backdrop of seasons and
        schooling being the main indicator. Documents obtained from
        the Immigration Museum confirm that my mother’s family arrived
        in Melbourne on November 29. They initially stayed at a boarding
        house on Nicholson Street in Fitzroy for a month with my grandfather’s
        sister and brother-in-law. Below, hear my mother relive her first
        ever conversational encounter with the English language.

          Early the next year they moved to Kyabram,
          a rural town in Northern Victoria, for tomato-picking season.
          A few weeks after arriving my grandmother, badly burnt by
          the Australian sun, was briefly hospitalised and obtained large
          blisters. Her family then began working at Ky Cannery,
          where her father was a forklift driver
          and her mother and aunt worked in the production line,
          stoning and packing peaches. With the commencement of a new
          term, my mum and her siblings began schooling at Kyabram Primary School.
          <p>
            <p>

Back then Kyabram had a very minimal migrant population
which alienated my mother’s family from the rest of the community,
a sentiment that played out in the schoolyard.
“At the time, the people of Kyabram were quite intolerant of migrants”,
 mum remembers. “Most of the migrants in that area were either Albanian
 or Italian and went to the local catholic school, so [at the public
 primary school] it was a really hostile, unfriendly, unwelcoming place
 - I remember not having a friend for at least twelve months and kids making
 fun of how unclean I was.” The cultural differences between my mother,
 her siblings and the other students was reflected most prominently in food
 and dress, “we looked like peasants in our mismatching colours”, she laughs.
 Because of these experiences, my mum is now a staunch advocate
 for the school uniform over casual dress. She looks back at her time in
 Kyabram negatively and
 has not returned since, a poignant gesture for a usually
 sentimental person who regularly travels across the state for work.

My mum and her family left
Kyabram in 1972 to live in Collingwood,
where they bought two homes with the savings they’d made.
In comparison, she reflects on her time in Collingwood fondly -
at the time a huge melting pot for different migrant communities.
Her family sponsored a number of friends and family from Serbia to migrate,
solidifying their own sense of community in Melbourne along with finacial comfortability.
However, a number of unfortunate
incidents saw a downturn in the family’s wellbeing.
The first was a car accident in 1973 where mum’s parents,
aunt and uncle were driving back from a wedding in Kyabram
(my mother and her siblings had been left at home)
that killed her uncle. The second was more drawn out and
complex: because her family had acted as guaranteers for a number of
Serbian individuals migrating, when some decided
to go back home they would leave the family to pay various abandoned outstanding debts.
These two factors took a huge economic toll on the family and forced them
to sell both homes, downsizing to commission housing. More problematically,
my grandfather’s alcoholism took a downward spiral over this period -
a substance abuse that almost killed him. Despite these difficult domestic issues,
growing up in the Collingwood flats was extremely formative for mum and helped
her develop her own sense of belonging amongst other like-minded youth.

    They moved to Sunshine in the late 1970s,
    where mum’s parents lived until my grandmother’s death
    in 2001. They transformed an old post-war weatherboard
    house into a quintessentially Serbian-village home,
    complete with chickens, a mini-orchard and vegetable garden.
    “My parents sacrificed many opportunities for a comfortable life,
    to work two or three jobs at a time to support their extended family a
    nd provide security for their children”, mum reflects. “However as a
    result they weren’t fluent in English which created a barrier between them,
    their children and their grandchildren.” Mum’s migrant experience, while typical of the time, is
    powerfully humble in its lived experience of barriers and belonging.
